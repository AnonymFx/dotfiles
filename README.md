# dotfiles
This is a project for my personally used dotfiles.
Use at own risk.

## VIM
For the given vim configuration to work, the YouCompleteMe autocomplete plugin has to be built and properly installed. See the [documentation]{https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/} for further reference.
Note that submodules have to be pulled with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

For javacomplete2 maven has to be installed and `mvn compile` has to be executed in the .vim/bundle/vim-javacomplete2/libs/javavi

For autoformat, global formatting programs have to be installed. For available options see its Github [page]{https://github.com/Chiel92/vim-autoformat}.
